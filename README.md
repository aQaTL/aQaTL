# Hi, this is aQaTL

I'm a software developer from Poland. Currently focused on Rust, before that, I was using Go,
which I still like a lot. Together with Rust, there's also some Javascript / Typescript
involved in my day, although I'm no frontend guy ;). When I do have to make a website, 
Vue.js is my choice (learning React though).

This account hosts my side projects, I also have a website [aqatl.pl](https://aqatl.pl).
